# Mini Product Analytics Engine

A lightweight product analytics engine inspired by tools like PostHog.

This project demonstrates how product event data can be ingested, modeled, and queried to answer common product questions.

---

## Problem

Most SaaS products generate large volumes of behavioral event data but lack a simple way to analyze it without a full analytics platform.

This project explores a minimal architecture for turning raw product events into actionable insights.

---

## Running the project

1. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the analytics pipeline

python run_queries.py

This will load the event dataset into DuckDB and execute the example analytics queries.

The output includes:
- Daily active users
- Activation funnel
- Activation rate

---

## Architecture

Event data → DuckDB warehouse → SQL analytics layer → AI query interface

The goal is to show how a small set of components can support common product analytics workflows.

---

## Data Model

The system operates on a simple event table:

events

user_id  
event  
timestamp  

Each row represents a user performing an action inside a product.

Example events include:

- signup
- create_project
- invite_teammate
- view_dashboard

---

## Example Analytics

The repository includes example SQL queries for:

Daily active users  
Activation funnels  
Activation rate

These queries demonstrate how product behavior can be analyzed using a warehouse-first approach.

---

## Example Product Questions

How many users signed up this week?

How many users created a project after signing up?

What percentage of users activate?

---

## Future Improvements

Possible extensions include:

- streaming event ingestion
- retention cohort analysis
